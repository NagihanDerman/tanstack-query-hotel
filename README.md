### Accommodation Search and Booking Application

This project is an Accommodation Search and Booking application developed using React and modern web technologies. Customers can use this application to search for accommodations, view their details, and make reservations.

## Features

- View Accommodations: Customers can see the rating, star level, nightly price, and amenities of the accommodations.
- Sorting Options: Sort accommodations by price (low to high, high to low) or star rating.
- Add/Remove Accommodations: Admins can add or remove accommodations through the application.
- Availability Check: Users can check the availability status of accommodations.
- Notifications: The application displays notifications for actions performed (e.g., success, error messages).

## Backend

In addition to the frontend, a simple backend was created to manage and serve the accommodation data. The data presented in the application is fetched from this backend.

## Technologies Used

- React: The core library for building the user interface.
- Vite: Build tool for a fast development environment.
- Tanstack Query: Used for server state management and data fetching.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and design.
- Axios: Used for managing API requests.
